# Database
There is a dental clinic managed by several dentists. Each dentist receives some patients. For each patient several appointments are booked in different days and times.
Each appointment is made between dentist and patient so that appointment time and date do not conflict with other appointment like dentist should not have another meeting with other patient at same date and time and same for patient.
Each patient may have 1 or more insurance policies. We need to store the information of insurance policies of the patients.
Some patients may not have an insurance policy and they pay the expenses from their pocket. We also need to store the payment history of the patient.
A bill is issued to the patient which includes total amount to be paid and bill ID.
A patient may pay full bill once or in different installments.
For installments payment plan is made for patient in which the start and end of plan is stored along with payment period of the installment, remaining amount to be paid and status(active or completed).
The payment can be fully paid by insurance or insurance can cover some amount of payment.
Payment can be made by cash, card or online banking.
Patients can refer their friends and families and we store this information in the database too.
